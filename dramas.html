      <h4>Your Turn to Kill</h4>
      <p>I think this was our very first drama we watched together, not counting those we watched in the server.
        I love this drama because it was mystery and crime related. There was another one I watched I think it was called 
        Guilty Flag and it was from the same creator too. But yeah I think this was way back in like 2021.

      <h4>Taxi Driver 1 & 2</h4>
      <p>My all-time favorite drama. Lmao we are still in the taxi driver server i created. I remember how you kept praising me 
        about the taxi bot i created when it was really nothing. You were too sweet. This drama was amazing, and revenge can sometimes be very satisfying.
        Season 3 is coming soon so let's wait for that and watch it together.

      <h4>Singles Inferno 3</h4>
      <p>It's so funny how we never watched 1 and 2 and went straight to watch the 3rd season of Singles Inferno. I love this show and the drama
        that was between the participants. It was also pretty entertaining to watch you get really involved and started ranting about them. So much so that your
        feed was filled with reels from them.

      <h4>Love Catcher in Bali</h4>
      <p>I think this was the first ever dating variety show we watched. I don't really remember much about this but I do like that they have a psychological 
        element to it because someone could be a money catcher and not all of them are there for love. But this show also got me really liking dating shows in general,
        I think it's pretty fun.

      <h4>Is She the Wolf?</h4>
      <p>First ever Japanese dating show. I think this was really cozy and comfortable to watch. There wasn't much drama nor over-the-top acting. I also remember
        how we both were just cheering Julie on. That was pretty funny. We were really engrossed in it. We need to watch more dating shows fr.

      <h4>Sweet Home 1,2,3</h4>
      <p>This show was truly a rollercoaster of emotions. It was gory and there were so much action going on. When I was watching this, I was always 
        on the edge of my seat. It was an amazing experience. Season 1 started great but by season 3 I could kinda feel they are just dragging things along,
        But overall, this was a great drama.
