      <h4>A Sign of Affection</h4>
      <p>I love this anime. I love how Itsuomi always is considerate about Yuki and how he always 
        look out for her despite her having hearing impairments. He always bring things from overseas 
        and tell stories to Yuki. I want to be like him one day. 10/10 slice of life anime.

      <p>I really love this anime as well. Apart from the very confusing time travelling stuff in,
        this anime brings out love in its purest form. And that soulmates will eventually find each other even
        if they are from timelines. 100/10 romance anime

      <p>I think this anime was the first we watched after we were officially together. It really hits different
        when you are watching romance with someone you love. I know love is not always about butterflies and having strong feelings.
        A big part of love is also accepting the flaws of the other person, no matter how weird/scary/crazy they are, like Sawako Kuronuma.
        Kazehaya wasn't perfect either, but this anime taught me that good communication is the key to a successful relationship. 1000/10 romance anime

      <h4>Jujutsu Kaisen</h4>
      <p>I think this anime was fine at the start but got really trash like halfway through. I think that's why we dropped it right lmao.
        4/10 weird anime

      <h4>One Piece Live Action</h4>
      <p>This live action was really well done and exceeded many fans expections. it was really funny and exciting and adventurous,
        just like how our lives together will be soon. If the anime was shorter and more compact, I think you'd have enjoyed it much more.
        It's a good anime that talks about the power of friendship and the idea of never giving up no matter what it takes. Overall, 1000/10 anime.

      <h4>Solo Leveling</h4>
      <p>Lmao this anime is nice at the start but got a little bit boring towards the end. Ngl this anime has pretty sick animation. It was quite cool how he starts off weak and gets stronger day
        by day. I think this anime taught me to never give up even in hardship, and things will turn out fine in the end. 7/10 action anime.
